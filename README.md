# RacmanJava
## Overview
[racman](https://www.github.com/MichaelRelaxen/racman) like app written in Java so it can be run on MacOS and Linux out of the box.
I made this specifically for one person in mind and it turns out they can't actually use it but I'm still working on this because I'm bored.
Right now it only supports a small subset of UYA features, namely savefile helper, file manip setup, and position codes.

## How to run

You need a Java runtime of version 17 or higher. Download the jar file and run it.
That's pretty much it, the setup on your PS3 is the same as on racman (install HEN/CFW and WebMAN)

## How to build
